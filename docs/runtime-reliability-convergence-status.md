# Runtime Reliability Convergence Status

This is a durable status map, not a mutable execution manifest. The Stage 2
closure is the commit containing this file on branch
`feature/runtime-reliability-convergence`; its parent is
`8c73b932dc09ca4569f6e1082b3680ead876c18c`.

## Stage map

| Stage | Status | Evidence and qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — authority freeze | Complete | Recorded by the retained `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` and the checked-in runtime/product-policy artifacts. This chronology is inferred from the handoff because no separate Stage 0 commit is present. |
| 1 — typed product authority and contracts | Complete in branch candidate | `tasks/product_authority.py`, `tasks/flow_delivery_product_policy.json`, and the three bound BlueStacks contracts now carry the exact static-UTC policy and revision/digest binding. Offline authority tests are the verification evidence. |
| 2 — Resource Effect Authority | Complete in branch candidate | `safe_action_core/resource_effect_authority.py` releases active reconciliation claims transactionally with terminal observe-only reconciliation; `scripts/pnsctl.py` binds Resource identity to validated product authority. Focused Resource tests are the verification evidence. |
| 3 — control primitives | Not started | No Stage 3 implementation, live admission, registration, or scheduler promotion is authorized by this candidate. |

## Frozen product rule

Daily reset is exactly `00:00:00 UTC` every `86400` seconds. The typed
policy is `daily-reset-static-utc-midnight`, scoped to `global.daily_reset`,
`explicitly_approved`, and sourced from
`explicit_user_direction_2026-08-20`.

## Retained canary and terminal semantics

The retained canary row intentionally remains
`FIXED_RUNTIME_BINDING_RESET_OBSERVED` with its historical Quest/OCR evidence.
The production path now derives static UTC identity from the validated
fixed-slot authority. A retained row is reusable only when account, server,
runtime scope, reset start, and reset deadline are exactly equal; the
candidate does not rewrite historical identity evidence.

The retained `result.json` uses adapter state `HOME`. The canonical terminal
observation and terminal projection explicitly store `HOME_CANONICAL`; these
are distinct evidence layers.

Prospectively, terminal observe-only reconciliation releases claims in
`ACTIVE` or `RECONCILIATION_ONLY` state in the same transaction as the
reservation, attempt, and generic action terminalization, while leaving
`RELEASED` and `EXPIRED` claims unchanged. The existing canonical historical
claim row's literal durable state column remains `ACTIVE`; its `expires_at` has
elapsed, so it is expired by lease semantics and therefore non-authorizing. It
was not rewritten by this candidate.

No extra live canary was run for this closure. Production registration remains
`NOT_REGISTERED`, scheduler eligibility remains disabled, and the active
runtime target remains private local BlueStacks.

## Validation status

The final focused Resource profile passed 65 tests with receipt digest
`a77ba8c3a0365bab64e3eceb35f5f6fa843afed8ab2e6a9bca2ae4ad70ebcc6d`.
The direct authority/identity/Resource suites passed 65 tests, and the adjacent
catalog/Nova suites passed 46 tests. Independent review and recheck reported no
remaining must-fix finding.

The architecture profile ran 92 tests and remains red with 21 errors and 4
failures. An isolated run at the unchanged parent commit produced the same
result, so these are recorded baseline failures rather than regressions from
this closure:

- 20 errors: the archived Resource live-attempt ordinals in the retained queue
  are not contiguous (`process_state`; owner: flow-delivery queue hygiene).
- 1 error: the legacy handoff-render test expects `first_ready_flow`
  (`test_contract`; owner: flow-delivery workflow tests).
- 4 failures: stale expected queue membership/order, local `.cursor/hooks.json`
  presence, queue-validation error precedence, and missing-verifier error
  precedence (`test_contract` or local process state; owner: flow-delivery
  workflow tests).

No new failure in a Stage 2 touched behavior was observed. The architecture
profile is not reported as passing and should be repaired by its owning
workflow task rather than by broadening this Resource closure.
